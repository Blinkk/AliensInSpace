Space Invaders Clone written in C++ using DirectX API's

This game is a Space Invaders clone and it was created as a project for my 2D DirectX class at Westwood College.
This game uses many art assets found online, some of which are the original assets from Space Invaders and Galaga. I do not own
the rights to these assets and they will not be used in the final version of this game IF it is ever to be published. If and when this game is published, all art assets will be recreated by a game artist and be original work to whom that artist will be credited. Thank you.
